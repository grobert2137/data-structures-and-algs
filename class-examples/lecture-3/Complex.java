// Complex.java

// A traditional attempt at adding two complex numbers
// Not a very good approach, but why not?

// Its a bad example becaseu this is how you would write java if it wasn't OOP (object oriented programming)
// We would ideally want to access these as a complex number CLASS then create two accessible sub-classes of real and imag.

public class Complex {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        double realPart1 = 2.5;
        double imagPart1 = 1.7;
      
        double realPart2 = 1.0;
        double imagPart2 = 3.0;

        double realSum;
        double imagSum;

        realSum = realPart1 + realPart2;
        imagSum = imagPart1 + imagPart2;

        System.out.println(realPart1 + "+" + imagPart1 + "i" + " + " +
